# Overlaid configs

To allow continuously importing changes from the upstream kernel
config ([currently arch linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages/packages/linux/trunk/config))
all changes made by the Eupnea team are stored as individual overlay configs that are appended to the base config.

A daily workflow pulls the fresh upstream config into base-kernel.conf , appends the overlay configs (from
kernel-conf-overlays) and runs `make olddefconfig` to automatically combine the configs (the appended config options are
prioritized over the base config options) to create combined-kernel.conf which can then used to build the kernel.
